# BankerBot-AI-Chatbot-with-Amazon-Lex-AWS-Lambda

## Project Overview
This project showcases BankerBot, an AI-powered banking chatbot built using Amazon Lex, AWS Lambda, and CloudFormation. The chatbot simulates a basic banking assistant capable of:
•	Greeting users
•	Responding to balance inquiries
•	Transferring funds
•	Handling fallback messages
•	Carrying over context between interactions
As an aspiring Cloud Engineer, this project demonstrates my ability to build scalable, secure, and serverless applications on AWS. It incorporates key AWS services such as Lex, Lambda, IAM, and CloudFormation, aligning with real-world enterprise chatbot architecture.
